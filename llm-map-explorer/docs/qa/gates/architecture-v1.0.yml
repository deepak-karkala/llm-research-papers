# Minor Enhancement Opportunities (Non-Blocking)

optional_improvements:
  - id: 'ARCH-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'No explicit database schema section (intentional for static-first MVP)'
    suggested_action: 'Document "No Database - Static JSON" decision more prominently in High-Level Architecture'
  - id: 'ARCH-002'
    severity: low
    finding: 'API specification section skipped (correct for MVP, but could be placeholder)'
    suggested_action: 'Add placeholder section: "API Specification: N/A - Static-First MVP (Section 5 reserved for post-MVP backend)"'
  - id: 'DOC-005'
    severity: low
    finding: 'Security section could expand on Content Security Policy details'
    suggested_action: 'Add CSP configuration example in Security section (Section 11)'
