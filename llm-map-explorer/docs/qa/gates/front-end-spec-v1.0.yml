# Quality Assessment

strengths:
  - pixel_perfect_wireframes: '7 detailed ASCII art wireframes with exact dimensions (1920×1080, responsive breakpoints) ready for Figma translation'
  - comprehensive_coverage: '16 major sections covering philosophy, journey mapping, wireframes, components, style guide, accessibility, development handoff'
  - implementation_ready: 'Complete TypeScript interfaces, Zustand store architecture, performance patterns, ARIA examples with code snippets'
  - accessibility_first: 'WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements, keyboard navigation map, screen reader compatibility, color contrast specs'
  - user_centered: 'Emotional journey mapping with 4 personas, pain point resolution table, user moment identification'
  - quick_reference: 'Well-organized quick reference section for designers, developers, QA, and planners'

# Minor Enhancement Opportunities (Non-Blocking)

optional_improvements:
  - id: 'DOC-003'
    severity: low
    finding: 'No explicit mobile (375px) wireframes for touch interactions'
    suggested_action: 'Add mobile-specific wireframes in Phase 4 (responsive optimization)'
  - id: 'DOC-004'
    severity: low
    finding: 'Component prop types could be more detailed (optional vs required)'
    suggested_action: 'Refine TypeScript interfaces during component implementation with required/optional markers'

# Comparison with Industry Standards

exceeds_standards:
  - 'Pixel-perfect wireframes exceed typical UX spec detail level (most provide only conceptual wireframes)'
  - 'TypeScript interfaces for data models rare in UX docs (excellent bridge to development)'
  - 'Performance optimization patterns included (usually separate doc)'
  - 'Complete keyboard navigation map (often overlooked in UX specs)'
  - 'User journey mapping with emotional states (premium UX practice)'
  - 'Development handoff section with code examples (exceptional)'
