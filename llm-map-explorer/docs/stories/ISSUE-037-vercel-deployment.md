## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Create Vercel Project

Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com):

1. Sign in or create account
2. Click "Add New" → "Project"
3. Select GitHub repository: `llm-research-papers`
4. Configure project:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js ✅ (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./llm-map-explorer`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Development Command: `npm run dev`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

---

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.terra-incognita-linguae.app (if applicable)
NODE_ENV=production
VERCEL_ENV=production
```

For different environments:
- **Production:** All required env vars
- **Preview:** Same as production (for consistent testing)

---

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings

Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Build & Development Settings:

- **Ignored Build Step:** (leave empty - build always)
- **Build Cache:** Enable (speeds up rebuilds)
- **Framework Override:** Next.js
- **Environment Variables:** ✅ (configured above)

---

### Step 4: Set Security Headers

Create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "SAMEORIGIN"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        },
        {
          "key": "Permissions-Policy",
          "value": "accelerometer=(), camera=(), microphone=()"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "destination": "/:path*"
    }
  ],
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "https://:host$:port/:path*",
      "permanent": true,
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "header",
          "key": "X-Forwarded-Proto",
          "value": "http"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

In Vercel Dashboard → Domains:

1. Click "Add"
2. Enter domain: `terra-incognita-linguae.app`
3. Select "Add Domain"
4. Configure DNS:
   - Option A: Use Vercel Nameservers (easiest)
   - Option B: Add CNAME record if using existing DNS
5. Verify domain
6. SSL certificate auto-provisioned

---

### Step 6: Set Up GitHub Integration

Vercel automatically configures GitHub integration:

- PR previews enabled ✅
- Automatic deployments enabled ✅
- Vercel bot comments on PRs ✅
- Deploy status checks on PR ✅

Configure in Vercel Dashboard → Git:

- **Deployment Branches:** `main` (production)
- **Preview Branches:** All other branches
- **Production Branch:** `main`

---

### Step 7: Enable Analytics

In Vercel Dashboard → Analytics:

- Enable Web Analytics ✅
- Enable Vitals ✅
- Track custom metrics (optional)

View dashboard for:
- Pageviews
- Response times
- Error rates
- Core Web Vitals

---

### Step 8: Create `.env.example`

Create `.env.example` in repo root:

```bash
# Vercel-specific (auto-set)
VERCEL_ENV=production
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=xxx
VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_ID=xxx

# Application configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.terra-incognita-linguae.app

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=

# Feature flags (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_TOURS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SHARING=true
```

---

### Step 9: Update README with Deployment Info

Add to `README.md`:

```markdown
## Deployment

This project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Live URLs

- **Production:** https://terra-incognita-linguae.vercel.app (or custom domain)
- **Preview:** Auto-generated for each PR

### Deploying to Production

The app automatically deploys to production when changes are merged to `main` branch.

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and push
3. Open pull request
4. Vercel automatically creates preview deployment
5. Test preview deployment
6. Merge to `main` when ready
7. Vercel automatically deploys to production

### Environment Variables

Configure in Vercel Dashboard:

```
VERCEL_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

### Rollback

If production deployment has issues:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find previous stable deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Monitoring

- View analytics: Vercel Dashboard → Analytics
- Check logs: Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → [deployment] → Logs
- Monitor errors: Vercel Dashboard → Monitoring (if enabled)

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy (Preview)
vercel

# Deploy to Production
vercel --prod
```
```

---

### Step 10: Verification Checklist

Create `.github/deployment-checklist.md`:

```markdown

- **Configuration:** 15 minutes
- **Testing:** 15 minutes
- **Documentation:** 10 minutes
- **Total:** ~1 hour (2 story points)

### Best Practices
1. **Test preview first** - Always verify preview before production
2. **Monitor after deploy** - Check logs and metrics post-deploy
3. **Keep rollback ready** - Know how to revert if needed
4. **Automate everything** - Use CI/CD for deployments
5. **Document process** - Make it easy for team to deploy

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails** - Check node_modules, clear cache
2. **Wrong env vars** - Verify in Vercel dashboard
3. **CORS issues** - Check allowed origins
4. **Slow builds** - Enable build cache
5. **Preview not updating** - Clear cache or retrigger deployment

**This issue is successfully complete when:**

✅ Vercel project configured correctly
✅ Build succeeds automatically
✅ Production deployment live and working
✅ Preview deployments functional
✅ All features verified in production
✅ Analytics operational
