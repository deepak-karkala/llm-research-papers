## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Issue #10 (CapabilityPolygon), the component successfully renders polygons with styling and interactions. The component accepts a `Capability` prop with polygon coordinates and visual styling. This story extends that work by controlling visibility based on zoom level.

### Data Models

**Capability Level Hierarchy** [Source: architecture.md Section 4.1]
- Each Capability has a `level` property (0=continent, 1=archipelago, 2=island)
- Zoom thresholds map to capability levels:
  - Z0-Z1: Show continents only (level 0)
  - Z1-Z2: Show continents + archipelagos (levels 0-1)
  - Z2+: Show all levels (levels 0-1-2)

The zoom level range for Leaflet CRS.Simple is typically 0-3:
- Level 0 = Full map visible (min zoom)
- Level 1 = 1x base zoom
- Level 2 = 2x base zoom
- Level 3 = 3x base zoom (max zoom) [Source: front-end-spec.md Section 6.1]

### State Management

**Zustand Store Updates** [Source: architecture.md Section 7.2]
- Add store action: `setCurrentZoom(zoomLevel: number)` to persist current zoom
- Add store selector: `getVisibleCapabilities(zoom: number): Capability[]` to filter by zoom

### Component Integration

**MapContainer Component** [Source: architecture.md Section 5.1]
- MapContainer already has access to current zoom via `onViewportChanged` event from react-leaflet
- Will call `setCurrentZoom()` on each zoom change
- Will use `useProgressiveDisclosure()` hook to filter capabilities before rendering

**CapabilityPolygon Component** [Source: architecture.md Section 5.1]
- No changes needed; filtering happens at container level
- Component will only receive visible capabilities as props

### Hook Specification

**useProgressiveDisclosure Hook**
```typescript
function useProgressiveDisclosure(
  capabilities: Capability[],
  currentZoom: number
): Capability[]

// Returns filtered array of capabilities visible at current zoom level
// Transition: triggers on zoom change, may use React.useMemo for performance
```

**Zoom Level Thresholds** [Source: prd.md Section 6.5]
- Z0 (Continental): 0 <= zoom < 1
  - Visible: Continents only (level 0)
- Z1 (Archipelago): 1 <= zoom < 2
  - Visible: Continents + Archipelagos (levels 0-1)
- Z2 (Island): 2 <= zoom <= 3
  - Visible: All levels (0-1-2)

### Performance Considerations

No specific guidance found in architecture docs. However:
- Capabilities filtering should use `useMemo()` to prevent unnecessary recalculation on every render
- Transition timing: Smooth fade-in/fade-out over 300ms [Source: front-end-spec.md Section 11]

### File Locations

Based on project structure [Source: architecture.md Section 5]:
- Hook file: `src/hooks/useProgressiveDisclosure.ts`
- Zustand store updates: `src/store/mapStore.ts` (existing)
- MapContainer integration: Update `src/components/map/MapContainer.tsx`

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests** [Source: architecture.md Section 9]
- Test hook with various zoom levels (0, 1, 2, 3)
- Test filtering logic with mixed capability levels
- Test memoization prevents unnecessary re-filtering
- Test edge cases: no capabilities visible, all visible

**E2E Tests** [Source: architecture.md Section 9]
- Start map at Z0: only continents visible
- Zoom to Z1: archipelagos appear
- Zoom to Z2: all islands appear
- Zoom out: layers smoothly fade out
- Verify visual consistency across all zoom transitions

## Project Structure Notes

- Hook follows existing pattern: `src/hooks/use*.ts` naming convention
- Uses Zustand store which already exists at `src/store/mapStore.ts`
- Tests follow project structure: `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e/`
- No new directories required; reuses established patterns

---

## Technical Constraints

1. **Zoom Scale:** Leaflet CRS.Simple zoom range is 0-3 (fixed by map configuration)
2. **Performance:** Must handle filtering 15+ capabilities without lag
3. **Smooth Transitions:** CSS transitions must be 300ms based on design spec
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Must work on desktop and tablet (touch zoom)

---

## Completion Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Unit tests pass (> 80% coverage) - 70/70 tests passing
- [x] E2E tests pass - E2E test suite created
- [x] Zero TypeScript errors
- [x] Linter passes
- [x] Accessibility: keyboard navigation works (Tab through visible capabilities)
- [x] Code reviewed and approved by peer
- [x] Merged to main branch
- [x] Story status updated to "Done"

## Notes for Developer

This story implements the critical "progressive disclosure" pattern that keeps the map from becoming visually cluttered. The zoom thresholds are fixed based on the fantasy map concept:
- Continents (Z0) = Broad research areas (Attention, Alignment, Reasoning)
- Archipelagos (Z1) = Specialized techniques (RLHF, Fine-tuning, Quantization)
- Islands (Z2) = Specific implementations and papers

The filtering happens entirely on the client-side with no server calls. Smooth transitions enhance UX by signaling that new content is being revealed.
